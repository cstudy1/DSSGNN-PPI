## DSSGNN-PPI
  DSSGN-PPI is a new model for making multi-type predictions of PPIs,A multimodal approach combining structural and protein sequence information was used.The model achieves very excellent results.
  The environment configuration required for this project is shown in `requirements.txt`.

  How to extract the structural information of a protein and compose a graph. As shown in the figure below
